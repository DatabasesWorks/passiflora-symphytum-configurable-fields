How to translate Symphytum in your local language
_________________________________________________

1. Update the TRANSLATIONS variable in the Symphytum.pro file so that your TS file is created in the stuff/translations directory. This is only needed for new languages.
2. Run 'lupdate-qt5 -noobsolete Symphytum.pro' to update/create all TS files in the stuff/translations directory
3. Open and translate the TS file with QtLinguist
4. To create the QM language file, run 'lrelease-qt5 Symphytum.pro'
5. Move the QM files to the resources/languages directory
6. If needed, update the resources.qrc file in the resources directory
7. Optionally, to improve and fully complete the translation, a qt_xx.qm file is also needed in your local language. The Qt framework provides some of them which are translated and compiled TS files. Copy the appropriate qt_xx.qm file to the resources/languages directory and update the resources.qrc file.
